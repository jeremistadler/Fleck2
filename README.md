This branch will contains Fleck2: https://github.com/peters/Fleck2

without extensions ( see commit https://github.com/username1565/Fleck2/commit/cf2963b064ac0597285bdf41d1a4f2d61bad5d17 )

and the Fleck2-demo without dll (just .exe): https://github.com/username1565/Fleck2/commit/0c27bee5c6de75fc1342f9f2325428ac4baea8c0

Dll-files still can be compiled, by running build.bat (maybe need to run this twice).

Some files was been deleted. Some folders was been renamed. See commits description...
